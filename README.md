# takeon-validation-formula-evaluator
Core engine of the validation process. Evaluates each formula and returns the response.


**Not production code** <br/>
No logging behaviour
No formal unit test suite
Limited error handling

**pyparsing.py** <br/>
Library file which provides the formula parsing. 
Primary source: https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing

**ValidationParser.py** <br/>
Class to provide the definition of a valid formula.

**ValidationParserStack.py** <br/>
Class to provide the behaviour of each operation within a formula.

**ValidationRunner.py** <br/>
Single function which accepts a list containing 'fomrula' and 'metadata'.
Instantiates the parser and iterates over the list to produce an output list

**lambda_function.py** <br/>
Lambda entry point.
Unpacks the given json depending on whether it has been called via API gateway or directly.
If it has been given a valid JSON payload evaluate it.
Returns the given output list from the evaluator

**test_harness.py** <br/>
Wrapper class for grouping some behaviour tests


**Input JSON** <br/>
<pre><code>{
  "validation_input": 
    [
      { "formula": "abs(12) < 3000", "metadata": {} },
      ...
      { "formula": "(abs(25)>0 AND 0=0), "metadata": {"reference": "49900001", "survey": "099", "period": "201409" } 
    ]
}</pre></code>
**Output JSON** <br/>
<pre><code>{
      { "formula": "abs(12) > 3000", "triggered":False, "metadata": {} },
      ...
      { "formula": "(abs(25)>0 AND 0=0), "triggered":True, "metadata": {"reference": "49900001", "survey": "099", "period": "201409" }

## Depolyment
This repo is integrated with Concourse for 'linting-&-tests' and 'serverless deployment'.  The 'pipeline.yml' file defines the concourse pipeline which uses the 'params.yml' file for 'aws_region', 'ecr_repository' and 'git_repository'. Other parameters used in the pipeline are defined as 'secrets' in AWS.

**Steps** <br/>
The pipeline is designed as 2 steps process -
1. If any pull request is raised in this Git Repo from any feature branch, then it will automatically trigger to run the concourse pipeline for 'linting-&-tests' on that feature branch.
2. It will deploy the lambda as 'severless deployment' into AWS once the feature branch is merged into 'dev' branch.

The commands to manually 'destroy', 'set-pipeline' and 'unpause-pipeline' are avilable in 'concourse-run.sh'
